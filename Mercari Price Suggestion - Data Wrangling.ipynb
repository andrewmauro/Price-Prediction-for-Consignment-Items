    "To prepare the Mercari Price dataset for visualization by cleaning and extracting additional information from text columns, and calculating average prices based on grouped categorical features. In addition, Natural Language processing will be performed to obtain additional features for prediction purposes.\n",

    "Procedures\n",
    "\n",
    "The following data wrangling steps were performed:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The 'category_name' field was split into five levels of category names, with each level increasing in specificity.\n",
    "2. NULL values in all columns were replaced with 'Unknown'\n",
    "3. Averages were calculated, grouping by each categorical variable (with the exception of item description)\n",
    "4. Natural Language processing was performed on the 'item_description' field. The text was normalized to stem, lemmatize all words in each item descritpion and remove stop words. The following additional features were derived for prediction:\n",
